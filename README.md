# Multi Omics Reproducible Workflows
Reproduce multi omics machine learning methods for CompBio-Lab. Below are a list of methods:
- MOGONET
- DIABLO
- Cooperative Learning
- Single Cell MultiOmics

They all have single repos, links will be added later. And they have a workflow file (GNU `make` or `snakemake`) to reproduce the method (i.e. detailed instructions).
