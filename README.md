# Multi Omics Reproducible Workflows
Reproduce multi omics machine learning methods for CompBio-Lab. Below are a list of methods:
- MOGONET
- DIABLO
- Cooperative Learning
- Single Cell MultiOmics

They all have single repos, links will be added later. And they have a workflow file (GNU `make` or `snakemake`) to reproduce the method (i.e. detailed instructions). 

## Instructions

You will likely find a directory named of `NAME_OF_THE_METHOD`, within it you should be able to find a `Makefile` that auto creates the environment locally and reproduce the methods results. Moreover, there should also be a `README.md` within the same directory that details the instructions to reproduce it on *sockeye*.
