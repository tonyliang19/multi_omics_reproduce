# Cooperative Learning

This is a supervised learning method for **multiple sets of features ("views")**. It combines the usual squared error loss of predictions with an **"agreement" penalty** to encourage predictions from diffrent data views to agree.

The method can be especifically powerful when different data views share some **underlying relationship in their signals** that cant be exploited to boost the signals
